# Chemistry-Periodic-Table
I created a Periodic Table of Elements using HTML and Inline CSS. It shows all elements with their symbols, atomic numbers, and masses, arranged by categories like metals, non-metals, metalloids, noble gases, and transition elements. This table helps understand the structure, properties, and relationships of all chemical elements easily.
